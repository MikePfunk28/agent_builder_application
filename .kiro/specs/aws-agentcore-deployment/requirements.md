# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive AWS AgentCore deployment system that enables users to build, test, and deploy AI agents to AWS Bedrock AgentCore Runtime with integrated authentication through AWS Cognito or AWS Single Sign-On. The system provides a seamless workflow from agent creation to production deployment, supporting both local testing with Ollama and cloud testing with AgentCore sandbox environments.

## Glossary

- **AgentCore Runtime**: AWS Bedrock service that hosts containerized AI agents with automatic scaling and session management
- **Strands Agents**: The primary AI agent framework used for building agents
- **Cognito User Pool**: AWS service for user authentication and authorization
- **AgentCore Identity**: AWS service for managing inbound and outbound authentication for agents
- **Docker Container**: Containerized package containing the agent code and dependencies
- **ECR Repository**: Amazon Elastic Container Registry for storing Docker images
- **CloudFormation Template**: AWS infrastructure-as-code template for resource provisioning
- **CDK Script**: AWS Cloud Development Kit script for programmatic infrastructure deployment
- **OAuth 2.0**: Authentication protocol used for secure user authentication
- **Session Management**: System for maintaining user conversation context across interactions
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automated process for building, testing, and deploying agents

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to authenticate using AWS Cognito or AWS SSO, so that I can securely access the agent deployment platform and deploy to my AWS account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform, THE Authentication_System SHALL present login options for AWS Cognito and AWS SSO
2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates with Cognito, THE Authentication_System SHALL store their JWT token and AWS credentials securely
3. WHEN a user authenticates with AWS SSO, THE Authentication_System SHALL automatically configure their AWS account access for deployment
4. IF authentication fails, THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL display clear error messages and retry options
5. WHILE a user session is active, THE Authentication_System SHALL maintain their authentication state and refresh tokens as needed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create AI agents using the Strands Agents framework, so that I can build intelligent applications with various AI models and tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Agent_Builder SHALL provide a web interface for configuring agent properties including model selection, system prompts, and tool integration
2. WHEN a user selects a model type, THE Agent_Builder SHALL display compatible configuration options for that model
3. THE Agent_Builder SHALL support both Ollama and AWS Bedrock model configurations
4. WHEN a user defines agent tools, THE Agent_Builder SHALL validate tool configurations and dependencies
5. THE Agent_Builder SHALL generate valid Strands Agent code that follows AgentCore Runtime requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test my agents locally or in a sandbox environment, so that I can validate functionality before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests agent testing, THE Testing_System SHALL offer both local Ollama and AgentCore sandbox testing options
2. WHERE local testing is selected, THE Testing_System SHALL create a Docker container with Ollama and execute the agent
3. WHERE AgentCore sandbox testing is selected, THE Testing_System SHALL deploy the agent to a temporary AgentCore Runtime environment
4. THE Testing_System SHALL capture and display agent responses, logs, and performance metrics during testing
5. WHEN testing completes, THE Testing_System SHALL provide detailed results and recommendations for improvement

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically generate deployment artifacts, so that I can deploy my agent to AWS without manual infrastructure setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Deployment_Generator SHALL create a Dockerfile with agent code, dependencies, and AgentCore Runtime configuration
2. THE Deployment_Generator SHALL generate either CloudFormation templates or CDK scripts based on user preference
3. THE Deployment_Generator SHALL include ECR repository configuration for container image storage
4. THE Deployment_Generator SHALL configure AgentCore Identity settings for authentication
5. THE Deployment_Generator SHALL include monitoring and observability configurations using CloudWatch and X-Ray

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy my agent to AWS AgentCore Runtime with one click, so that I can quickly move from development to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates deployment, THE Deployment_System SHALL build the Docker container and push it to ECR
2. THE Deployment_System SHALL execute the CloudFormation template or CDK script to provision AWS resources
3. THE Deployment_System SHALL create the AgentCore Runtime with the container image and configuration
4. THE Deployment_System SHALL configure endpoints and authentication settings for the deployed agent
5. WHEN deployment completes, THE Deployment_System SHALL provide the agent endpoint URL and testing instructions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage authentication and authorization for my deployed agents, so that only authorized users can access them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Identity_Manager SHALL configure AgentCore Identity with the user's Cognito User Pool settings
2. THE Identity_Manager SHALL support both user-delegated and autonomous authentication modes
3. WHEN configuring inbound authentication, THE Identity_Manager SHALL set up OAuth 2.0 with the user's identity provider
4. THE Identity_Manager SHALL configure allowed audiences and client identifiers for token validation
5. THE Identity_Manager SHALL provide configuration for outbound authentication to third-party services

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor and manage my deployed agents, so that I can ensure they are performing correctly and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Monitoring_System SHALL integrate with AWS CloudWatch to collect agent metrics and logs
2. THE Monitoring_System SHALL provide X-Ray tracing for request flow analysis
3. WHEN agents encounter errors, THE Monitoring_System SHALL capture detailed error information and stack traces
4. THE Monitoring_System SHALL track session management including creation, duration, and termination
5. THE Monitoring_System SHALL provide dashboards for agent performance and usage analytics

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update and version my deployed agents, so that I can improve functionality while maintaining service availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates agent code, THE Versioning_System SHALL create a new AgentCore Runtime version
2. THE Versioning_System SHALL maintain immutable versions for rollback capabilities
3. THE Versioning_System SHALL update the DEFAULT endpoint to point to the new version automatically
4. WHERE custom endpoints exist, THE Versioning_System SHALL allow selective version updates
5. THE Versioning_System SHALL support zero-downtime deployments during version transitions
