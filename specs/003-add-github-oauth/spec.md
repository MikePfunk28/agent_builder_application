# Feature Specification: GitHub OAuth Sign-In

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-github-oauth`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Add GitHub OAuth sign-in button to the authentication page. Users should be able to click "Sign in with GitHub" button that triggers OAuth flow using the configured GitHub App (Client ID: Ov23liUe2U4dpqlFQch3). The button should appear alongside the existing email/password and anonymous sign-in options, maintaining consistent styling with the rest of the auth interface. After successful GitHub authentication, users should be redirected back to the application and automatically signed in.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Sign In with GitHub Account (Priority: P1)

Users who have GitHub accounts can quickly sign in to the application using their GitHub credentials without creating a separate password, reducing friction in the onboarding process.

**Why this priority**: This is a core authentication option that reduces barriers to entry. GitHub is the primary platform for developers (the target audience), making this the most natural sign-in method. Without this option, users must create and remember additional credentials.

**Independent Test**: Visit the sign-in page, click "Sign in with GitHub", authorize the app, and verify automatic sign-in to the application. Delivers immediate GitHub authentication capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the sign-in page, **When** they view authentication options, **Then** they see a "Sign in with GitHub" button displayed prominently
2. **Given** a user clicks "Sign in with GitHub", **When** the OAuth flow initiates, **Then** they are redirected to GitHub's authorization page
3. **Given** a user authorizes the application on GitHub, **When** GitHub redirects them back, **Then** they are automatically signed in to the application
4. **Given** a new user signs in with GitHub for the first time, **When** authentication completes, **Then** their account is created using their GitHub profile information
5. **Given** an existing user signs in with GitHub, **When** authentication completes, **Then** they access their existing account and data
6. **Given** a user completes GitHub sign-in, **When** they view their session, **Then** they remain signed in across page refreshes and browser sessions

### User Story 2 - Handle Authentication Errors Gracefully (Priority: P2)

Users who encounter issues during GitHub OAuth (denying permissions, network errors, or already-linked accounts) receive clear feedback and can retry or choose alternative sign-in methods.

**Why this priority**: While less common than successful sign-ins, error handling is critical for user experience. Poor error handling leads to abandoned sign-ups and support requests.

**Independent Test**: Deny GitHub authorization and verify the app shows a helpful error message with recovery options. Delivers robust error recovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user denies GitHub authorization, **When** they return to the application, **Then** they see a clear message explaining the denial and can retry or use alternative sign-in
2. **Given** the GitHub OAuth service is temporarily unavailable, **When** a user attempts GitHub sign-in, **Then** they see a helpful error message suggesting they try again later
3. **Given** a user's GitHub account is already linked to an existing app account, **When** they try to sign in, **Then** they are signed into their existing account without duplication
4. **Given** an OAuth error occurs, **When** the user views the error message, **Then** they can easily return to the sign-in page to try alternative methods
5. **Given** a network interruption during OAuth, **When** the flow times out, **Then** the user sees a timeout message and can retry
6. **Given** authentication fails, **When** the error message displays, **Then** it does not expose technical details or security-sensitive information

### User Story 3 - Consistent Visual Experience (Priority: P3)

Users experience a visually cohesive authentication page where the GitHub sign-in button matches the style, spacing, and layout of existing authentication options.

**Why this priority**: While less critical than functionality, visual consistency improves perceived quality and reduces cognitive load. Inconsistent UI can make users question the legitimacy of the OAuth integration.

**Independent Test**: Review the sign-in page and verify the GitHub button matches styling of other authentication buttons. Delivers professional appearance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user views the sign-in page, **When** they compare authentication options, **Then** all buttons have consistent heights, padding, and border radius
2. **Given** the GitHub button is displayed, **When** users view it, **Then** it uses appropriate GitHub branding (logo/icon) that is clearly recognizable
3. **Given** multiple authentication options exist, **When** users scan the page, **Then** options are logically grouped with clear visual separation
4. **Given** a user hovers over the GitHub button, **When** the hover state triggers, **Then** the visual feedback matches the hover behavior of other buttons
5. **Given** the page displays on different screen sizes, **When** users view it on mobile or desktop, **Then** the GitHub button remains properly sized and accessible
6. **Given** a user navigates the page with keyboard, **When** they tab to the GitHub button, **Then** focus indicators are clearly visible

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's GitHub account email doesn't match their existing app account email?
- How does the system handle users who revoke app permissions in GitHub after signing in?
- What happens when GitHub returns incomplete profile data (missing email, name, etc.)?
- How are concurrent sign-in attempts from the same user handled?
- What happens if the OAuth callback URL changes or becomes misconfigured?
- How does the system handle users signing in from restricted networks that block GitHub?
- What happens when a user tries to link multiple GitHub accounts to one app account?
- How are state parameter validation failures handled to prevent CSRF attacks?
- What happens if the GitHub OAuth app is temporarily suspended or rate-limited?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The sign-in page MUST display a GitHub authentication option alongside existing sign-in methods
- **FR-002**: The GitHub sign-in button MUST initiate the OAuth authorization flow when clicked
- **FR-003**: The system MUST redirect users to GitHub's authorization page with correct application credentials
- **FR-004**: The system MUST handle OAuth callbacks and exchange authorization codes for access tokens
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be automatically signed in after successful GitHub authorization
- **FR-006**: The system MUST create new user accounts for first-time GitHub sign-ins using profile information
- **FR-007**: The system MUST link returning users to their existing accounts based on GitHub identity
- **FR-008**: The system MUST display clear error messages when OAuth fails or users deny authorization
