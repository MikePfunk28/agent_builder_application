# Feature Specification: Containerized Agent Testing System

**Feature Branch**: `002-fix-docker-spawn`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Fix Docker spawn ENOENT error by implementing a proper containerized agent testing architecture. The current implementation tries to execute Docker commands directly from Convex serverless actions which don't have Docker installed. Solution requires creating an AWS ECS/Fargate service or Lambda container that can execute Docker builds and runs, with Convex actions queuing test requests and polling for results. This enables users to test their Python agents with real Ollama or AWS Bedrock connections in isolated Docker containers, generating deployment artifacts (agent.py, Dockerfile, requirements.txt, AWS CDK scripts) that users can download and deploy.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Test Agent in Isolated Environment (Priority: P1)

Users create Python agents in the builder and execute real tests against their chosen model providers in isolated, containerized environments to verify functionality before deployment.

**Why this priority**: This is the critical blocker preventing users from validating their agents. Without working tests, users cannot verify agent behavior, leading to deployment failures and lack of confidence in the platform. This directly impacts the core value proposition of the application.

**Independent Test**: Create an agent, click "Execute Test", and verify the test runs without "Docker spawn ENOENT" errors. Delivers immediate agent validation capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has created an agent with Python code, **When** they click "Execute Real Docker Test", **Then** the test request is submitted successfully without infrastructure errors
2. **Given** a test is submitted, **When** the containerized execution service processes it, **Then** the agent runs in an isolated environment with access to the specified model provider
3. **Given** an agent uses Ollama models, **When** the test executes, **Then** the container can connect to the local Ollama service and receive responses
4. **Given** an agent uses cloud-based models, **When** the test executes, **Then** the container has proper credentials and network access to make API calls
5. **Given** a test is running, **When** the user refreshes the page, **Then** the test continues executing and shows current status
6. **Given** a test completes, **When** the user views results, **Then** they see the agent's response, execution time, and resource usage

### User Story 2 - Download Deployment Artifacts (Priority: P2)

Users who successfully test their agents can download complete deployment packages containing all necessary files and deployment scripts to run their agents in production environments.

**Why this priority**: After validating agents work correctly, users need deployment artifacts to actually use them. This completes the agent creation workflow and enables the hackathon deliverable requirement of providing downloadable, deployable agents.

**Independent Test**: Test an agent successfully, then click "Download Deployment Package" and verify the download contains agent.py, Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and deployment scripts. Delivers production deployment capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a test completes successfully, **When** the user clicks "Download Deployment Package", **Then** a zip file downloads containing the agent code file
2. **Given** the deployment package, **When** the user extracts it, **Then** it contains the container definition file with proper base image and dependencies
3. **Given** the deployment package, **When** the user reviews it, **Then** it includes a dependency specification file listing all required packages
4. **Given** the deployment package, **When** the user examines deployment scripts, **Then** they find infrastructure-as-code templates for cloud deployment
5. **Given** different model providers, **When** users download packages, **Then** each package is customized with provider-specific configuration and credentials handling
6. **Given** the downloaded package, **When** a user follows the included README, **Then** they can deploy the agent to their own infrastructure within 15 minutes

### User Story 3 - Monitor Test Execution (Priority: P3)

Users observe real-time progress of their agent tests through live console output, status updates, and detailed execution logs to understand test behavior and debug issues.

**Why this priority**: While P1 enables testing and P2 provides deliverables, visibility into test execution helps users understand failures, optimize performance, and build confidence in the testing process.

**Independent Test**: Start an agent test and verify real-time logs appear showing build progress, container startup, agent initialization, and test execution. Delivers test transparency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a test is running, **When** the user views the test panel, **Then** they see live console output streaming in real-time
2. **Given** test execution progresses, **When** each stage completes, **Then** the status indicator updates to show current phase (queued, building, running, completed)
3. **Given** a test fails, **When** the user reviews logs, **Then** they can identify the failure point and error message
4. **Given** multiple tests are queued, **When** the user views the test interface, **Then** they see their position in the queue and estimated wait time
5. **Given** a long-running test, **When** the user checks progress, **Then** they see elapsed time and can cancel if needed
6. **Given** test completion, **When** the user reviews metrics, **Then** they see execution time, memory usage, and container resource consumption

---

### User Story 4 - Retry and Manage Tests (Priority: P4)

Users who encounter test failures or want to validate changes can retry tests with the same or modified queries and manage their test history.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the user experience by providing test management capabilities, but is not critical for the core testing workflow to function.

**Independent Test**: Run a test, make a change to the query or agent code, and retry the test while maintaining access to previous test results. Delivers iterative testing capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a failed test, **When** the user clicks "Retry Test", **Then** the test re-executes with the same configuration
2. **Given** test results, **When** the user modifies the test query, **Then** they can run a new test without losing previous results
3. **Given** multiple test runs, **When** the user views test history, **Then** they see a chronological list of all tests with timestamps and outcomes
4. **Given** test history, **When** the user selects a previous test, **Then** they can view full logs and results from that test
5. **Given** a running test, **When** the user clicks "Stop Test", **Then** the test terminates gracefully and releases resources
6. **Given** accumulated test history, **When** the user clears history, **Then** old test records are removed to save space

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the container execution service is unavailable or at capacity?
- How does the system handle extremely long-running tests (over 10 minutes)?
- What happens when a container crashes or becomes unresponsive during test execution?
- How are API rate limits handled for cloud model providers during testing?
- What happens when a user submits multiple tests simultaneously?
- How does the system handle malicious or resource-intensive agent code in tests?
- What happens when network connectivity to model providers is lost mid-test?
- How are tests managed when the user's session expires or they close the browser?
- What happens when deployment artifact generation fails after a successful test?
- How does the system handle version mismatches between agent dependencies and container environments?
