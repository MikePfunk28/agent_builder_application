Yes, absolutely! You can use the script from that AgentCore Identity quickstart page. That's the official AWS documentation for setting up authenticated agents with the starter toolkit.

Here's what that script does:

1. Environment Setup:
```bash
mkdir agentcore-identity-quickstart
cd agentcore-identity-quickstart
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install bedrock-agentcore boto3 strands-agents bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit pyjwt
```
Run in CloudShell
2. Creates requirements.txt:

bedrock-agentcore
boto3
pyjwt
strands-agents
bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit
