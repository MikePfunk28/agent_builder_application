# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Cloudflare Pages Deployment Build Failure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Status**: PASSED

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, technology-agnostic, and ready for planning.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear problem statement with well-defined root cause
- Measurable success criteria that are technology-agnostic
- Comprehensive edge cases considering future npm changes
- Well-prioritized user stories (P1: CI/CD, P2: Local dev, P3: Documentation)
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- Functional requirements are testable without implementation details
- Explicit out-of-scope section prevents scope creep

**Readiness**: This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.implement`

## Detailed Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

**No implementation details**: ✓ PASS
- Spec describes the problem (.npmrc blocking optional dependencies) and desired outcomes (successful builds)
- No mention of specific Vite APIs, Rollup internals, or Cloudflare Pages configuration details
- Configuration file changes described at conceptual level (allow optional dependencies)

**Focused on user value**: ✓ PASS
- P1 user story directly addresses deployment capability
- P2 user story addresses developer productivity
- P3 user story addresses knowledge transfer and maintainability
- All stories have clear "Why this priority" rationale

**Written for non-technical stakeholders**: ✓ PASS
- Uses business language (deployment, productivity, knowledge transfer)
- Technical terms (Rollup, Vite) are contextualized as "build tools" and "dependencies"
- Success criteria focus on measurable business outcomes (100% build success, zero manual intervention)

**All mandatory sections completed**: ✓ PASS
- User Scenarios & Testing: 3 prioritized stories with acceptance criteria
- Requirements: 8 functional requirements, 3 key entities
- Success Criteria: 5 measurable outcomes
- Assumptions: Technical and business assumptions documented

### Requirement Completeness Review

**No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: ✓ PASS
- Zero clarification markers in the entire spec
- All requirements are concrete and specific

**Requirements are testable**: ✓ PASS
- FR-001: Testable by running CI/CD build on Linux
- FR-002: Testable by running build on Windows dev machine
- FR-003: Testable by verifying optional dependencies are installed
- FR-005: Testable by executing `vite build` and checking exit code
- FR-006: Testable by checking npm install output for warnings
- FR-008: Testable by performing fresh clone and build without custom steps

**Success criteria are measurable**: ✓ PASS
- SC-001: 100% success rate (binary metric)
- SC-002: Within 10% of baseline (percentage metric)
- SC-003: Zero manual interventions (count metric)
- SC-004: No warnings (binary metric)
- SC-005: Within 5 minutes (time metric)

**Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: ✓ PASS
- All criteria describe outcomes, not implementation (builds complete, no warnings, time limits)
- No mention of specific npm commands, Rollup internals, or Vite configuration
- Focused on user-facing and observable outcomes

**All acceptance scenarios defined**: ✓ PASS
- User Story 1: 4 acceptance scenarios covering push, install, build, consistency
- User Story 2: 3 acceptance scenarios covering Windows install, build, fresh clone
- User Story 3: 3 acceptance scenarios covering documentation, modification, troubleshooting

**Edge cases identified**: ✓ PASS
- 5 edge cases documented:
  - npm breaking changes (platform/arch deprecation)
  - New platform architectures (ARM, Apple Silicon)
  - Rollup binary distribution changes
  - Linux development machines
  - Explicit optional dependency exclusion

**Scope is clearly bounded**: ✓ PASS
- Out of Scope section explicitly excludes 7 related but non-essential items:
  - Package manager migration
  - Build tool changes
  - Platform configuration changes
  - Performance optimizations
  - Rollback mechanisms
  - Monitoring systems
  - npm deprecation warning resolution

**Dependencies and assumptions identified**: ✓ PASS
- 4 technical assumptions documented
- 4 business assumptions documented
- 4 external dependencies listed
- 3 internal dependencies listed

### Feature Readiness Review

**All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: ✓ PASS
- User story acceptance scenarios map to functional requirements
- Each FR can be validated through specific test actions

**User scenarios cover primary flows**: ✓ PASS
- P1: CI/CD deployment flow (primary blocker)
- P2: Local development flow (productivity)
- P3: Configuration understanding flow (maintenance)

**Feature meets measurable outcomes**: ✓ PASS
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-005 directly support user stories
- Each criterion validates a specific aspect of the fix

**No implementation details leak**: ✓ PASS
- Configuration changes described conceptually (.npmrc modification)
- No specific npm command syntax beyond standard `npm install` and `npm run build`
- No Rollup API calls or Vite configuration details exposed
