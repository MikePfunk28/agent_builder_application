# Feature Specification: Fix Cloudflare Pages Deployment Build Failure

**Feature Branch**: `001-fix-cloudflare-pages`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Fix Cloudflare Pages deployment build failure caused by missing Rollup platform-specific binaries. The build fails because the .npmrc configuration blocks optional dependencies with 'optional=false', preventing npm from installing @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu which is required for Vite to build on Linux CI/CD environments. The solution removes the optional=false restriction while maintaining platform and architecture settings to ensure correct binary installation across Windows development and Linux deployment environments.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Successful CI/CD Deployments (Priority: P1)

Developers push code changes to the repository and the Cloudflare Pages CI/CD pipeline automatically builds and deploys the application without manual intervention or build failures.

**Why this priority**: This is the core issue blocking all deployments. Without successful CI/CD builds, no features can be deployed to production, directly impacting business operations and user access to updates.

**Independent Test**: Push any commit to the repository and verify the Cloudflare Pages build completes successfully without Rollup binary errors. Success delivers immediate deployment capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer pushes code to the main branch, **When** Cloudflare Pages triggers a build, **Then** the build completes successfully without "Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu" errors
2. **Given** the CI/CD environment is running on Linux, **When** npm install executes, **Then** the platform-specific Rollup binary for Linux is installed correctly
3. **Given** the build process runs `vite build`, **When** Rollup is invoked, **Then** it finds and uses the correct platform-specific binary without errors
4. **Given** multiple deployments occur in a day, **When** each build runs, **Then** all builds succeed consistently without intermittent failures

### User Story 2 - Consistent Local Development (Priority: P2)

Developers working on Windows machines can build the application locally without encountering platform-specific dependency conflicts or installation errors.

**Why this priority**: While P1 unblocks production deployments, this ensures developers can verify their changes locally before pushing, reducing failed CI/CD runs and improving developer productivity.

**Independent Test**: Run `npm install` and `npm run build` on a Windows development machine and verify successful completion without wrong-platform binary warnings. Delivers local verification capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer runs `npm install` on Windows, **When** dependencies are installed, **Then** the Windows-specific Rollup binary is installed without Linux binary conflicts
2. **Given** a developer runs `npm run build` locally, **When** the build executes, **Then** it completes successfully using the Windows Rollup binary
3. **Given** a fresh clone of the repository, **When** a developer sets up the project, **Then** no manual workarounds or configuration changes are needed for the build to work

---

### User Story 3 - Configuration Transparency (Priority: P3)

Team members understand why the .npmrc configuration exists and how it affects dependency installation across different environments.

**Why this priority**: While lower priority than fixing the build, clear documentation prevents future configuration mistakes and helps onboarding new team members.

**Independent Test**: Review .npmrc comments and related documentation to verify the configuration purpose is clearly explained. Delivers knowledge transfer.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new team member reviews the .npmrc file, **When** they read the comments, **Then** they understand the purpose of the platform and arch settings
2. **Given** a developer needs to modify npm configuration, **When** they review the existing settings, **Then** they can identify which settings are critical for cross-platform compatibility
3. **Given** a troubleshooting scenario, **When** build issues occur, **Then** the .npmrc comments guide developers to the correct resolution

### Edge Cases

- What happens when npm introduces breaking changes to platform/arch configuration (as warned in current npm output)?
- How does the system handle new platform architectures (ARM, Apple Silicon) that may be introduced in CI/CD environments?
- What happens if Rollup updates their binary distribution model or package names?
- How does the configuration behave on Linux development machines (non-CI/CD context)?
- What happens if optional dependencies are explicitly excluded at install time using npm flags?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The build configuration MUST allow installation of platform-specific Rollup binaries on Linux CI/CD environments
- **FR-002**: The build configuration MUST allow installation of platform-specific Rollup binaries on Windows development environments
- **FR-003**: The npm configuration MUST NOT block optional dependencies that are required for build tools to function
- **FR-004**: The configuration MUST prevent installation of incorrect platform-specific binaries (e.g., Windows binaries on Linux)
- **FR-005**: The Cloudflare Pages build process MUST complete the `vite build` command successfully
- **FR-006**: The configuration MUST NOT cause npm warnings that indicate deprecated or unsupported settings
- **FR-007**: Documentation within configuration files MUST explain the purpose and implications of platform-specific settings
- **FR-008**: The solution MUST NOT require manual intervention or workarounds for standard `npm install` and `npm run build` workflows

### Key Entities

- **.npmrc Configuration**: Project-level npm configuration file that controls dependency installation behavior, including platform-specific settings and optional dependency handling
- **Build Artifacts**: The compiled output from the Vite build process that gets deployed to Cloudflare Pages
- **Platform-Specific Binaries**: Native executable modules (like @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu) that are installed conditionally based on the operating system and architecture

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of Cloudflare Pages deployment builds complete successfully without Rollup binary errors
- **SC-002**: Build times remain within 10% of baseline (no significant performance degradation from configuration changes)
- **SC-003**: Zero manual interventions required for builds across all environments (Windows dev, Linux CI/CD)
- **SC-004**: No deprecated npm configuration warnings appear during dependency installation
- **SC-005**: Developers can complete local builds from fresh repository clones within 5 minutes without configuration troubleshooting

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

### Technical Assumptions

- Cloudflare Pages build environment runs on Linux x64 architecture
- Local development primarily occurs on Windows machines
- The project uses Vite as the primary build tool, which depends on Rollup
- npm version supports platform and architecture configuration (though warnings indicate future deprecation)
- Rollup continues to distribute platform-specific binaries as optional peer dependencies

### Business Assumptions

- Deployment pipeline must remain operational without manual intervention
- Developer productivity is impacted by local build failures
- The current npm package manager will continue to be used (not switching to pnpm, yarn, etc.)
- Build configuration changes must maintain backward compatibility with existing development workflows

## Dependencies *(optional)*

### External Dependencies

- npm package manager behavior and configuration API
- Cloudflare Pages build environment specifications
- Rollup package distribution model for platform-specific binaries
- Vite build tool dependency on Rollup native binaries

### Internal Dependencies

- Existing .npmrc configuration must be modified
- Build scripts in package.json remain unchanged
- No changes required to source code or application logic

## Open Questions *(optional)*

No open questions at this time. The problem is well-defined and the solution has been implemented. Validation through testing is needed to confirm success criteria are met.

## Out of Scope *(optional)*

The following are explicitly out of scope for this feature:

- Migrating to alternative package managers (pnpm, yarn, bun)
- Upgrading or changing the build tool from Vite to alternatives
- Modifying the Cloudflare Pages deployment platform or configuration
- Adding build caching or optimization features
- Implementing automated rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
- Creating comprehensive CI/CD monitoring or alerting systems
- Addressing the npm deprecation warning for platform/arch settings (future consideration)
