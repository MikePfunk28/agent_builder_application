# Agent Builder Application - Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Immediate UI Improvements (CURRENT)

### Models
- Add all AWS Bedrock models (Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Opus, Nova, etc.)
- Add Ollama models (qwen3:4b, qwen3:8b, llama3.3, etc.)
- Group by provider with visual sections

### Tools  
- Add all 50+ strands-agents-tools
- Show pip dependencies and extras
- Mark Windows incompatible tools (python_repl, shell)

### Diagram
- Generate architecture diagram using diagram tool
- Add as downloadable tab alongside code

### Downloads
- Create complete ZIP package
- Include: agent.py, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, README, deployment configs

## Platform Restrictions

**NOT SUPPORTED ON WINDOWS:**
- python_repl (fcntl module)
- shell (compatibility issues)

## Next Phases

See full architectural plans in repository for:
- Docker testing infrastructure
- Meta-tooling capabilities
- Multi-cloud deployment
- AgentCore integration


 one later feature I want to add is being able to deploy your agent to aws with the       
  push of a button.  However remember to plan everything first and make sure the docker    
   sandbox is working and the ability to test the user created agent inside of that        
  docker container.  So it is then connected to the ollama model, the agentcore and        
  strandsagents tools, or bedrock if it is a bedrock model and all the tools work, and     
  it responds.
